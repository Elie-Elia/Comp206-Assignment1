ASSIGNMENT 1: Elie Elia - 260759306

SOLUTION1: 
104kg
364kg
450kg
1000kg
1800kg
4900kg
29000kg
110000kg
I found this by running:
cut -f1 -d" " *.dat | sort -n
Which only looks at the number in the first field in each .dat file (the weight) by cutting the String where the space is and sorts them in ascending numerical order

SOLUTION 2:
24m
13.5m
6m
5.15m
4.5m
4m
2.1m
2.0m
I found this by running:
cut -f2 -d" " *.dat | sort -n -rn
Which only looks at the second field number in each .dat file (length) and cuts the string where a space is found and then sorts them in reverse numerical order

SOLUTION 3: 
The elephant is heavier than the hippopotamus
I found this by running:
if [[ $(cut -f1 -d" " hippopotamus.dat) -gt $(cut -f1 -d" " elephant.dat) ]]; then echo The Hippopotamus is heavier than the elephant; else echo The elephant is heavier than the Hippopotamus; fi
which looks at the first number in the hippopotamus file (weight) and checks if it is greater than the first number in the elephant file(weight), and then prints which animal is heavier than the other as output

SOLUTION 4:
452
I found this by running:
sed -i 's/450kg/452kg/g' crocodile.dat
which through the Stream Editor uses the substitute command to replace 450kg by 452kg in the crocodile.dat file.

SOLUTION 5: I found this by running:
rm giraffe.*
which deletes any and all types of files related to giraffe
